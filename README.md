# 3ds-TitleID-Generator
This is an open source c++ application that extracts the title ID from a .cia file used by current nintendo systems.

# Usage:
Just drag and drop any cia files / folder containing cia files (or both at once) into the program and it will generate a text file containing cia names and their respective title ID's

# NOTE:
The program doesn't recursively browse folders, make sure your cia's are at the top of them otherwise they won't be read!
